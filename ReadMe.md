Catalyst
whats up laura!!

Catalyst is an app that puts the artist in the loop. Catalyst integrates with openAI’s API to create a responsive tool for generating unique and creative prompts. The prompts will then be used by the artist for inspiration and motivation to start creating. 

"Catalyst" serves as a bridge between artistic innovation and cutting-edge AI technology. As the  surge of AI advancements reshape tech landscapes, we are a team, driven by the idea of preserving the power and  magic of artistic generation , by  placing it firmly in the hands of the creators. 


Usage:
The purpose of our app is to create unique artistic prompts generated by OpenAI.  The main user interaction is to parametrize the information that we send to openAI’s API. Each medium has a carefully thought out series of selections for the user to make. Each of the 4 mediums gives the user over 7000 different combinations of words, ensuring a personalized and tailored AI generated prompt.

Our app serves as an invitation and muse, providing you with a simple yet effective process to generate ideas and catalyze your artistic practice. We're committed to building technology  that enriches the creative process rather than overpower it. 



Features:

AI generated prompts for Writing, Movement,  Visual Art and Music with user / human in the loop parameterization. 
Creative space for artists with timers, a notebook, and a lexicon
An AI powered Lexicon that can help artists define a word and generate creativity
